# Butaca: movie database #

## What is Butaca? ##

Butaca is a movie database application for MeeGo Harmattan, the operating
system running on the [Nokia N9][1]. You can use it to:

 * Get all details about a movies: release date, overview, cast & crew, trailer...
 * Get all details about a celebrity: birth details, biography, filmography...
 * Check showtimes -when available- for cinemas around you

## Get Butaca ##

Download Butaca at [openrepos.net][9]

## How does it work? ##

Butaca uses different data sources to present its content. It gets the
information about movies and celebrities from [The Movie Database][2], an open
movie database where everybody can collaborate. It shows movie showtimes -when
available- using results from [Google Showtimes][3].

## Bugs & Feedback ##

I -[Sim&oacute;n Pena][4]- develop Butaca on my free time. I am writing it hoping
that you enjoy it and find it useful, but there could be bugs or things you would
expect to work in a different way. If you find issues or have ideas to improve
this application, don't hesitate to create an entry in the [bug tracker][5].

## Known Issues ##

 * Butaca uses mainly `qsTrId` for translations. As reported in [QTBUG-17327][11],
in `Qt 4.7.1` `lupdate` won't extract engineering translations when `//%` is used.
Newer versions work fine.
 * There are a couple of `ListModels` translated manually using `Component.onCompleted`,
since as reported in [QTBUG-11403][12] and [QTBUG-16289][13], `qsTrId` cannot be
used inside `ListElement`
