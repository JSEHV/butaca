//! \class Controller
//! \brief Class exposing core functionality to the QML context
//!
//! This class exposes several methods, not available in pure QML, to the
//! context, such as sharing using the share-ui interface, retrieving movie
//! showtimes, accessing the current location, formatting a currency or saving
//! images
//!
//! \mainpage
//! Butaca is a movie database application
//! It provides:
//!
//! \li All details about a movie: overview, cast & crew, trailer...
//! \li All details about a celebrity: biography, filmography...
//! \li Whether a movie has extra content during or after the credits
//! \li Showtimes -when available- for cinemas around you
//!
//! You can also share links to a movie or celebrity, save them as favorites,
//! save movies to your watchlist, and save pictures into your phone's gallery.
