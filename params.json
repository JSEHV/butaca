{"name":"Butaca","body":"# Butaca: movie database #\r\n\r\n## What is Butaca? ##\r\n\r\nButaca is a movie database application for MeeGo Harmattan, the operating\r\nsystem running on the [Nokia N9][1]. You can use it to:\r\n\r\n * Get all details about a movies: release date, overview, cast & crew, trailer...\r\n * Get all details about a celebrity: birth details, biography, filmography...\r\n * Check whether a movie has extra content during or after the credits\r\n * Check showtimes -when available- for cinemas around you\r\n\r\n## Get Butaca ##\r\n\r\nDownload Butaca at the [Nokia Store][10]\r\n\r\n## How does it work? ##\r\n\r\nButaca uses different data sources to present its content. It gets the\r\ninformation about movies and celebrities from [The Movie Database][2], an open\r\nmovie database where everybody can collaborate. It shows movie showtimes -when\r\navailable- using results from [Google Showtimes][3]. And it checks if a movie\r\nhas extra content after or during the credits (also known as \"stinger\") using\r\n[What's After The Credits?][4], a website which provides that kind of\r\ninformation for movies, games and other media.\r\n\r\n## Bugs & Feedback ##\r\n\r\nI -[Sim&oacute;n Pena][5]- develop Butaca on my free time. I am writing it hoping\r\nthat you enjoy it and find it useful, but there could be bugs or things you would\r\nexpect to work in a different way. If you find issues or have ideas to improve\r\nthis application, don't hesitate to create an entry in the [bug tracker][6].\r\n\r\n## Contribute! ##\r\n\r\nButaca is free software, licensed under the [GPL 3.0][8] license, which means\r\nthere are several ways you can contribute to it:\r\n\r\n * [Fork the project][7], modify the sources, and send merge requests with patches\r\n * [Translate Butaca][9] to your language\r\n * File bugs or write feature requests in the [bug tracker][6]\r\n * Spread the word, and recommend it to your friends\r\n * Rate us on the [Nokia Store][10]\r\n\r\n## Awards ##\r\n\r\nButaca is a proud member of the [Qt Ambassador Program][11]\r\n\r\n## Known Issues ##\r\n\r\n * Butaca uses mainly `qsTrId` for translations. As reported in [QTBUG-17327][12],\r\nin `Qt 4.7.1` `lupdate` won't extract engineering translations when `//%` is used.\r\nNewer versions work fine.\r\n * There are a couple of `ListModels` translated manually using `Component.onCompleted`,\r\nsince as reported in [QTBUG-11403][13] and [QTBUG-16289][14], `qsTrId` cannot be\r\nused inside `ListElement`\r\n\r\n[1]: http://swipe.nokia.com/ \"Nokia N9\"\r\n[2]: http://www.themoviedb.org/ \"The open movie database\"\r\n[3]: http://google.com/movies \"Google Movie Showtimes\"\r\n[4]: http://aftercredits.com/ \"What's After The Credits?\"\r\n[5]: https://twitter.com/spenap \"Sim√≥n Pena\"\r\n[6]: https://github.com/spenap/butaca/issues \"Bug Tracker\"\r\n[7]: https://github.com/spenap/butaca \"Butaca on GitHub\"\r\n[8]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html \"GPL License\"\r\n[9]: https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/butaca/ \"Butaca: cinema information localization\"\r\n[10]: http://store.nokia.com/content/195876 \"Butaca at the Nokia Store\"\r\n[11]: http://qt.nokia.com/qt-in-use/ambassadors/project?id=a0F20000006N9pVEAS \"Butaca\"\r\n[12]: https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-17327\r\n[13]: https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-11403\r\n[14]: https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-16289\r\n","tagline":"Movie database application for the Nokia N9","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
